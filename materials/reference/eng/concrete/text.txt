Concrete technology has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, leading to the development of innovative mixtures with improved properties. One such example is the utilisation of a ternary mix, consisting of cementitious materials, supplementary cementitious materials, and superplasticizers, which has shown promising results.

Certainly! The utilisation of a ternary mix, which combines cementitious materials, supplementary cementitious materials, and superplasticizers, has shown promising results in enhancing the performance of concrete. Here are some relevant numbers:

The ternary mix typically consists of three main components: cementitious materials, supplementary cementitious materials (such as fly ash or slag), and superplasticizers.

The incorporation of supplementary cementitious materials can range from 10 to 60% by weight of the total cementitious content, depending on the desired properties and application requirements.

The addition of superplasticizers, such as high-range water reducers, can significantly improve the workability and flowability of the concrete mixture. Dosages of superplasticizers generally range from 0.5 to 2% by weight of cementitious materials.

The utilisation of a ternary mix has been found to enhance various properties of concrete, including compressive strength, flexural strength, durability, and resistance to cracking.

Studies have reported an increase in compressive strength of up to 25% when using a ternary mix compared to conventional concrete mixtures.

The ternary mix has also demonstrated improved resistance to chloride ingress and sulphate attack, enhancing the durability of concrete structures in aggressive environments.

The utilisation of supplementary cementitious materials and superplasticizers in the ternary mix contributes to sustainable construction practices by reducing the overall carbon footprint of concrete production.

It's important to note that the specific proportions and performance of the ternary mix may vary depending on factors such as project specifications, material availability, and desired concrete properties. Continuous research and development in the field of concrete technology aims to optimise the composition and proportions of the ternary mix to further enhance its performance and sustainability.

Studies have demonstrated that incorporating 1,500 concrete sludge particles in the mixture can enhance the flexural strength, with a recorded value of 589 MPa. Additionally, the splitting tensile strength of this mixture reaches 42%, indicating its ability to withstand internal forces and resist cracking.

The use of compact concrete with a block ratio of 150 contributes to its durability and structural integrity. The flowability of the mixture is also a crucial factor, with a flowability value of 0.0025, ensuring easy and efficient placement during construction.

The utilisation of geopolymer concrete has gained popularity, with approximately 74% of researchers exploring its potential. Geopolymer concrete exhibits a slump flow of 56 cm, indicating its excellent workability and ease of moulding into desired shapes.

Moreover, the incorporation of superplasticizers, such as the 2,450 type, further enhances the flexural stiffness and shear transfer capacity of the concrete. This leads to improved structural performance, especially in applications involving heavy loads.

Chemical reactions, such as pozzolanic reactions and the dehydroxylation of materials, contribute to the formation of essential compounds like calcium silicate hydrate and silicate hydrate. These compounds play a vital role in the long-term strength and durability of the concrete. Pozzolanic materials, such as fly ash, slag, and silica fume, react with calcium hydroxide (portlandite) in the presence of water to form additional calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel. The extent of pozzolanic reaction can vary depending on factors such as the type and fineness of the pozzolan, curing conditions, and the presence of activators.

Pozzolanic activity index: The pozzolanic activity of a supplementary cementitious material is often characterised using the pozzolanic activity index (PAI). PAI values range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating higher reactivity. For example, fly ash typically has a PAI ranging from 75 to 100.

It's important to note that the specific kinetics and extent of chemical reactions in concrete can vary depending on factors such as the composition of cementitious materials, curing conditions, and the presence of other additives or admixtures. Continuous research and understanding of these reactions contribute to the development of more durable and sustainable concrete formulations.

The advancements in concrete technology have also allowed for the reduction of environmental impact. For instance, the use of geopolymer technology has led to a decrease of approximately 780,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. This significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions showcases the potential of sustainable construction practices.

Looking ahead, ongoing research and development aim to optimise concrete mixtures further, focusing on factors such as the control of portlandite crystal formation and the understanding of the endothermic effects within the material. These endeavours will continue to drive advancements in the field, fostering the creation of durable and eco-friendly concrete structures.
