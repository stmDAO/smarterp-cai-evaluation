Occupational therapy is a healthcare profession that focuses on helping people of all ages to participate in meaningful activities, known as occupations. These activities can range from self-care tasks, such as bathing and dressing, to work-related tasks and leisure activities. Occupational therapy practitioners help individuals with a variety of conditions and disabilities, including developmental coordination disorders, neurological injuries, and chronic illnesses.

Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a condition that affects approximately 5-6% of children, or about 55 children in a classroom of 1,000. DCD is a motor skill disorder that affects a child's ability to coordinate movements and perform tasks that require motor skills, such as tying shoelaces or catching a ball. Children with DCD may also struggle with activities that require planning and organization, such as following a sequence of instructions.

Occupational therapy can be an effective treatment for children with DCD. Occupational therapists can work with children to improve their motor skills, as well as their ability to plan and organize tasks. Occupational therapy interventions for DCD may include activities to improve hand-eye coordination, balance, and strength, as well as strategies to help children break down tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.

Neurorehabilitation is another area of occupational therapy that focuses on helping individuals recover from neurological injuries or conditions, such as strokes or traumatic brain injuries. Occupational therapists can work with individuals to improve their motor skills, as well as their ability to perform everyday tasks, such as dressing and grooming.

The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE) is a tool that is used to measure empathy among healthcare professionals. The JSPE consists of 20 items and is scored on a scale from 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating greater empathy. A study published in the Journal of Occupational Therapy Education found that occupational therapy students had an average score of 4.2 on the JSPE, which is higher than the national average score of 3.94 for medical students.

The study, which included 232 occupational therapy students from Johnson University, also found that 75% of the students reported that they felt prepared to provide patient-centered care, and 42% reported that they felt prepared to work with patients with complex medical conditions. These findings suggest that occupational therapy education places a strong emphasis on developing empathy and patient-centered care skills.

One important aspect of occupational therapy education is the use of Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) to assess students' clinical skills. OSCEs are structured clinical simulations that allow students to practice and demonstrate their clinical skills in a controlled environment. A study published in the Journal of Occupational Therapy Education found that OSCEs were effective in assessing occupational therapy students' clinical skills related to performance measure reviews (PMRs), which are used to evaluate the effectiveness of occupational therapy interventions.

The study included 887 occupational therapy students who completed a total of 1,232 PMRs across multiple OSCE stations. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the OSCE scores and PMR scores was 0.63, indicating a moderate positive correlation between the two measures. The authors of the study suggest that OSCEs can be an effective tool for assessing occupational therapy students' clinical skills related to PMRs.

Paediatric neurology is another area of occupational therapy that focuses on helping children with neurological conditions, such as cerebral palsy or spina bifida. Occupational therapists who work in paediatric neurology may use a variety of assessment tools to evaluate children's motor skills and functional abilities. These assessments may include a baseline assessment to establish a starting point for treatment, as well as ongoing assessments to monitor progress.

In addition to motor skills, occupational therapy interventions for children with neurological conditions may also place a strong emphasis on behavioural skills. For example, occupational therapists may work with children to improve their ability to behave in different situations. Occupational therapy interventions, such as neuromotor task training and discrete motor skill training, can help children with different kinematic profiles to improve their motor performance and participate more fully in mainstream school activities. In addition to these interventions, occupational therapists may also work with families to build family resilience and provide peer mentoring to help children develop social skills. By breaking down the professional silos that can sometimes exist in healthcare, occupational therapists can provide a comprehensive approach to addressing the needs of children with neurological conditions and promoting their overall well-being.
